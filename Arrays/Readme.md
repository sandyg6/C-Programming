[P1](https://github.com/sandyg6/C-Programming/blob/main/Arrays/Pr0blem1.c). Write a program that takes two integer inputs and compares their digits. If the corresponding digits are equal, the program should output 0 for that digit position; otherwise, it should output 1. Finally, the program should display the decimal equivalent of the resulting binary number.
<pre>
Input: 
  6932 
  6832
Output: 4
Explanation:
6 and 6 - the first digits are same - So it is 0 
9 and 8 - the second digits are different - So it is 1 
3 and 3-3rd digits are the same - So it is 0 
2 and 2-4th digits are same - So it is 0 
So 0100 is the digit - this in decimal is 4
